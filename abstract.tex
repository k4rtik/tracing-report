From bare metal, to virtual machines, to containers and now to serverless, the cloud computing industry is making it easier and easier for developers to focus on writing code and not worry about how and where to deploy it. With this ease of use comes the problem of lack of visibility into the software stack, which is a critical need when things go wrong in production. We study the problem of tracing and instrumentation in distributed environments and present ongoing work on instrumenting an open source serverless framework, \emph{OpenWhisk}, using one of the most general-purpose and pervasive tracing platforms, \emph{Brown Tracing Framework}.
